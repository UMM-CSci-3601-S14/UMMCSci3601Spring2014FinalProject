            <p>At LightSide, we’ve developed software that can instantly evaluate student writing – but scores aren’t enough.
                In less than a second, we can grade an essay on multiple rubric scales and highlight the writer’s strongest
                and weakest passages on each dimension. Independent research has repeatedly shown that if all you’re
                interested in is a score, this technology is as accurate as human graders, and focuses on intuitive features
                of writing like content mastery, stylistic syntax choices, and genre awareness.
                <br/><br/>
                We believe we can do better. We’ve built a writing tool that lets students know where they stand as soon as
                they finish their first draft, that guides them through the revision process, and that delivers final work
                directly to teachers, where they can choose how to assess the work and whether to intervene. Our goal is to
                be a tool in the classroom, and to iteratively develop a platform that will fit the needs of English
                Language Arts teachers.
                <br/><br/>
                The state of writing in education is broken and getting worse. At LightSide, we’re inventing the tools that
                will support the next generation of student writers. Learn more about our pedagogy, our technology, and our
                Spring pilot by reading through our website, or contact us today to learn more.</p>
