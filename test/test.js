The best answer to that is to have a computer do it for you. In the future, hundreds of millions of jobs will be taken away from honest hard-working employees and will be given to computers.

Why would a business pay someone to take phone orders, when a computer can do it in less time and make it both cheaper and easier for the business and the buyer? Computers and the Internet are definitely affecting the way we entertain ourselves. The most basic example is card games. If the computer can deal out cards on a screen with the click of a button, why would anyone want to deal out a deck of cards manually and have to clean them up afterwards? On the Internet, you can gamble with on-line casinos, place bets on a horse race, or even watch movies. People can do all of these activities in the comfort of their own home. No gas money is wasted or time spent driving around to find entertainment so people are happy. The inevitable outcome of this magnificent invention is going to change the world. Society is happy about the way things are changing. Cheaper is better, less time consuming is better. With the choice of having a computer and being on-line, there is almost nothing you cannot do.

Society is changing by leaps and bounds, with no chance of a stopping point in the near future. All this change is dealing with computers and the effects that it will have on the way we live tomorrow. The Internet affects us in every way, most importantly with our social lives, our jobs, and our entertainment. Our social lives are not just communicating with telephones and mail anymore. Going “on-line” is the new way we like to communicate with people. Chat rooms on the Internet are open for people to talk and explore with other people who may live on the other side of the world or the other side of the street. E-Mail is also another popular way to correspond with others. Users can electronically send mail to another person with an on-line mailbox, simply by typing in their message and sending it by the click of a button. Two seconds to send e-mail to someone on the other side of the world is much quicker than a week or more through the ordinary mail. The Internet can also affect our jobs. Computers can calculate and figure out things much quicker than the average person. This process cannot only save time, but money too.
