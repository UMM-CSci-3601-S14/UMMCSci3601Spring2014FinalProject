Society is changing by leaps and bounds, with no chance of a stopping point in the near future. All this change is dealing with computers and the effects that it will have on the way we live tomorrow. The Internet affects us in every way, most importantly with our social lives, our jobs, and our entertainment. Our social lives are not just communicating with telephones and mail anymore. Going “on-line” is the new way we like to communicate with people. Chat rooms on the Internet are open for people to talk and explore with other people who may live on the other side of the world or the other side of the street. E-Mail is also another popular way to correspond with others. Users can electronically send mail to another person with an on-line mailbox, simply by typing in their message and sending it by the click of a button. Two seconds to send e-mail to someone on the other side of the world is much quicker than a week or more through the ordinary mail. The Internet can also affect our jobs. Computers can calculate and figure out things much quicker than the average person. This process cannot only save time, but money too.
